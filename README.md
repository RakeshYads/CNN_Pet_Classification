# Pet Classification (Cat & Dog) Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 🐱🐶

## Overview

Welcome to the Pet Classification project! 🎉 This repository showcases a model for classifying images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Whether you’re building a pet recognition app or just exploring image classification, this project offers a practical solution to differentiate between our furry friends. 🐾📸

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a robust CNN model to accurately classify images into two categories: cats and dogs. By leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks, we can achieve high accuracy in identifying and distinguishing between these two popular pets. 🧠🐾

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques to clean and prepare image data for training. 🖼️🧹
- **Feature Extraction:** Extract and learn features from images using convolutional layers. 🔍🧩
- **Model Building:** Construct and train a CNN model using libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. 🏗️📈
- **Evaluation:** Assess the model’s performance with metrics like accuracy and loss. 📊🔍
- **Visualization:** Visualize model performance and intermediate results with charts and sample images. 📉🔬

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled images of cats and dogs. It can be sourced from publicly available datasets like Kaggle's "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset or similar repositories. The images are preprocessed for consistency and quality. 📂🐕🐈

## Requirements

- Python 3.x 🐍
- TensorFlow 📚
- Keras 🔧
- Pandas 📊
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization) 🌈

## Installation

To get started, install the required libraries with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:** Load and preprocess the dataset using the provided scripts. 🛠️
2. **Model Training:** Train the CNN model by running the training script. 🚀
3. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's accuracy and make adjustments as needed. 📈🔍
4. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to classify new images of cats and dogs. 🔮
